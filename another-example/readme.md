# 3 Steps:

1) add [script to register service worker](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-service-workers/blob/master/another-example/script-to-add-to-index.html) to `index.html`
2) create `offline-page.html` (or edit the [code](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-service-workers/blob/master/another-example/service-worker.js) in a couple spots to point to `index.html` instead)
3) add [`service-worker.js`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-service-workers/blob/master/another-example/service-worker.js)
